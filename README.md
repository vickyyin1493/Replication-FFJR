# Replication-FFJR

This version of FFJR replication is our "initial data steps" on Financial Accounting Research project. 
We used the codes in the textbook and changed the frequency from monthly to daily data and used announcement 
dates instead of effective dates for stock splits. We restricted the window to be from 1990 - 2022 for our analysis.
